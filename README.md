## ðŸ“˜ Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

*Objective:*
To classify Iris flowers into different species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements.

*Steps Performed:*

* Loaded the dataset using pandas.
* Explored data with basic statistics and visualizations.
* Trained a classification model using Logistic Regression.
* Evaluated performance using accuracy and classification report.
* Visualized patterns using pair plots and heatmaps.

*Tools Used:*

* Python
* Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

*Outcome:*
Built a model with high accuracy (close to 100%) that can successfully classify Iris flowers into their correct species.

## ðŸ“— Task 2: Unemployment Analysis in India

*Objective:*
To analyze the unemployment rate in India based on state, region, and date using the provided dataset.

*Steps Performed:*

* Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
* Converted date column to datetime format.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Visualized unemployment patterns with bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.

*Tools Used:*

* Python
* Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

*Outcome:*
Identified trends of unemployment in different regions and states. Gained insights into how unemployment varied over time.

## ðŸ“• Task 3: Car Price Prediction

*Objective:*
To predict the selling price of used cars based on factors like year, fuel type, seller type, etc.

*Steps Performed:*

* Loaded and cleaned the car dataset.
* Encoded categorical data using LabelEncoder.
* Applied Linear Regression model to train the data.
* Evaluated the model using RÂ² score and visualizations.

*Tools Used:*

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

*Outcome:*
Created a predictive model that estimates used car prices accurately based on given input features.
